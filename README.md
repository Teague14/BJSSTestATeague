In the selenium project I would make a few updates if it was a real world project. I would create Enums for things such as Menu Items, Dress sizes etc. I would also have put in Waits rather than Thread.Sleep() where they were added. Due to the fact the project was to be handed in promptly I have left it the way that it is.
